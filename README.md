## How It Works

1. **Data Structure**: The program uses a **doubly linked list** to store and navigate browsing history.
   - The `prev` and `next` pointers allow backward and forward navigation.

2. **User Interaction**: The program provides a menu-driven interface to interact with the browsing history:
   - Add a website to the history.
   - View all visited websites.
   - Navigate through the history like a browser.

3. **Dynamic Updates**: Each action updates the data structure in real-time, ensuring consistency and accuracy of the browsing history.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)

## How to run
